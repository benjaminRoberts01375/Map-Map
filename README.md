# Key features
- Import or take a photo to turn into a Map Map.
    - Warp and stretch photos so they're always flat.
- Place multiple Map Maps on the background map.
    - Map Maps stick to the map, scaling, moving, and rotating right with it.
- Strong compatibility with landscape and portrait modes.
- Place Markers on MapMaps to help orient yourself.
    - Markers can optionally rotate with the map.
- Interaction eveywhere. If something's there, you can probably tap or even long press it.
- Switch between degrees and degree/minute/second notation.
- Compatible with iOS and iPadOS
